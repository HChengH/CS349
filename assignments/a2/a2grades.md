## MVC REQUIREMENTS [1/5]

-2 Data about the drawn shapes is not stored in the Model
-1 If you want to create a way that multiple changes in the model generate just one notification, this should all be handled within the model.
   Meaning, you should have one single entry method in the model, which calls the other methods, then notifies the view in the end.
   You cannot have the Controller calling multiple methods from the Model, then deciding when the Model should notify the views. This decision is not up to the Controller.
-1 You had several calls to repaint() directly in the View after changes in the Model, defeating the purpose of MVC.
   If you have a Model, and the View is notified when the model changes and it is time to repaint(), the idea is to avoid having the view manually call repaint() in other places.

## ENHANCEMENT [0/3]
